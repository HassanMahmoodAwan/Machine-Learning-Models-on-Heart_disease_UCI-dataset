# Machine-Learning-Models-on-Heart_disease_UCI-dataset
Applying Machine learning models on dataSet. But before that, Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering is Done. After that, Models are trained and Results of different models are displayed in form of Table


Steps Applied on This Project
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering  (Target feature is restcga)
- Machine Learning Models



> Note: As, its a classification problem. So, only classification models are used.  


### Machine Learning Models used are
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree Classifier with HyperTunning  (Grid Search / Random Search )
- Random Forest Classifier with HyperTunning  (Grid Search / Random Search )
